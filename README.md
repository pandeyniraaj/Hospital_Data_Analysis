🚨 Just Completed a Full SQL + Power BI Project! 🏥📊

I'm excited to share my latest portfolio project:
👉 Hospital Management System – Data Analytics with SQL & Power BI

Over the past few weeks, I worked with realistic hospital data including patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing to build:

✅ 25+ SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced
✅ A fully interactive Power BI dashboard covering revenue, patient demographics, appointment trends, and doctor performance
✅ A professional project report with documentation, ideal for internship/job submission

Key Insights I Uncovered:
📌 Top 3 revenue-generating patients
📌 Duplicate patient records flagged
📌 Doctors with no appointments
📌 Monthly revenue trend and treatment cost analysis
📌 Real-time KPIs: total revenue, active patients, appointments, and more
